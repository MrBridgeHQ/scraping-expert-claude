description: Senior-level guidance for designing, building, and debugging web scrapers on any platform - standalone scripts, cron jobs, serverless, web-app backends, or Apify Actors. Use this skill whenever the user wants to build, modify, or debug a scraper; whenever they mention web data extraction, anti-bot bypass (Cloudflare, DataDome, PerimeterX, Akamai, AWS WAF, rate limiting), proxy strategy, browser/TLS fingerprinting, Crawlee, Playwright, Puppeteer, Camoufox, got-scraping, or scraping a specific site. Trigger even when the user only describes a scraping problem - the right architectural choice almost always differs from their first instinct (nine times out of ten, an internal JSON API exists and they're about to scrape HTML for nothing). Also use it for choosing between scraping tools, debugging 403/429 errors, managed scraping APIs (Firecrawl, ZenRows, ScrapFly, ScraperAPI, Bright Data), proxy configuration, caching strategy, or selector breakage. Apply as soon as a target URL or site name appears in a scraping context.

# Scraping Expert

Senior-level doctrine for shipping scrapers that actually run for months. Scraping is engineering, not selectors - and the difference between a script that works once and a scraper that survives in production is a sequence of decisions made before a single line of code is written.

This skill is opinionated and **platform-agnostic**. It encodes patterns proven across scrapers with millions of runs, and integrates the 2026 anti-bot landscape. The doctrine here - diagnosis, tool choice, anti-bot strategy, resilience, failure handling, testing - applies to **any** scraper: a standalone Python/Node script, a cron job on a VPS, a serverless function, a web-app backend, or an Apify Actor. Apify is one deployment target among others; where a pattern is Apify-specific (PPE billing, `actor.json`, KV Store, Standby) it is called out as such.

The skill operates from one foundational frame: **anti-bot is an economic cost function, not an absolute wall.** No system that operates over the network is fully closed; the goal is not to be undetectable but to keep the cost-per-result below the value-per-result while staying under the trust threshold the target has set. There's a corollary to internalize early - when a target deploys government-ID-and-selfie verification (IDV), that is no longer a cost function; it is a hard limit. We don't engineer around IDV. See `references/legal-ethics.md` for the boundaries.

## Two recommended operating rules

These two rules reflect a safe production deployment model. They are strong defaults rather than universal law, but following them prevents the most common operational mistakes.

### Rule 1 - Don't scrape from your local/dev machine

All HTTP requests to target sites should run on **remote infrastructure** - Apify (Actors, proxies, browsers), your own deployed servers/VPS, or a managed scraping API (Firecrawl, ZenRows, ScrapFly, ScraperAPI). The local machine where you develop should never make a request to a target site. This protects your home/office IP from reputation damage and matches the production deployment.

The practical consequence is large: **local development uses fixtures, not the network**. Saved HTML/JSON responses (scrubbed of PII) live in `tests/fixtures/` and are loaded by the test suite via mocks. The first time you actually hit the target is in a deployed run (on Apify or your own infra). See `references/testing-fixtures.md` for the pattern.

When you want to "test this on the live site," the correct answer is: run it on the remote infrastructure, not locally. Avoid `curl` or `fetch` to the target from the local shell, even to "just check the page structure" - use existing scraped fixtures, the deployed environment, or a managed API if a probe is genuinely needed.

### Rule 2 - Keep scraper repositories private

Scraper code generally belongs in private repositories. *On Apify specifically:* deploy via the Apify CLI (`apify push`) or the API directly. Be deliberate about what ends up in publicly visible source files.

## Boundaries - the doctrine layer vs. implementation

This skill is the **doctrine and architecture layer**: diagnosis, tool choice, anti-bot strategy, resilience patterns, platform-agnostic failure handling, and testing doctrine. It decides **what to build and why**. It does NOT own the code scaffolding, the audit of an existing scraper, MCP-server implementation, monetization/PPE doctrine, content/marketing artifacts, or generic SEO. The Apify-specific *deployment* doctrine it does carry (graceful-exit + PPE engineering, `actor.json`/proxy/KV/Standby config) is segregated into clearly-labeled references.

When you want to actually build, audit, or wrap a scraper, the diagnosis/tool-ladder/anti-bot decisions here still apply - pair them with the relevant implementation tooling:

| Trigger | Where the implementation lives |
|---|---|
| Write/scaffold the actual scraper Actor **code** - Crawlee crawler setup, `input_schema.json`, `Dockerfile`, RequestQueue, no-code or AI-extraction templates | A dedicated Apify scraper-builder tool/skill (consumes this skill's tool-ladder + anti-bot doctrine) |
| **Audit an existing scraper** - coverage gaps, data-quality, selector rot, success-rate, cost-per-record, schema drift | A dedicated scraper-audit tool/skill (uses this skill as the doctrine layer for the fixes it recommends) |
| Build / modify / debug an **MCP server** Actor - Standby mode, transports (stdio / SSE / Streamable HTTP), `webServerMcpPath`, MCP server code | A dedicated Apify MCP-server-builder tool/skill |
| Which pricing model should I use? / How do I implement `Actor.charge()` correctly (full doctrine)? / Should I migrate off Rental? / `eventChargeLimitReached` handling doctrine | A dedicated Apify monetization tool/skill |
| README copy / Store description / SEO meta description / Actor display name + slug / pricing-section template / changelog format / Apify Store categories | A dedicated Apify content tool/skill |
| Generic SEO audit of a web project (Next.js / Astro / SvelteKit / WordPress / static site) - NOT Apify-specific | A dedicated SEO-audit tool/skill |

This file's `references/error-handling-ppe.md` documents the **scraping-engineering layer** of the graceful-exit + PPE-billing pattern; the canonical PPE doctrine belongs to a dedicated monetization tool. On any contradiction, the canonical monetization doctrine wins.

## The expert workflow

Every scraping project moves through these five phases in order. Skipping a phase is the root cause of scrapers that "worked yesterday" and don't today.

### Phase 1 - Diagnose the target (before writing any code)

Before choosing a tool, identify what you are up against. The diagnostic determines everything downstream - tool, proxy type, budget, timeline. A wrong diagnosis costs days. See `references/diagnostic.md` for the full procedure (including the Wappalyzer-first identification trick that turns 30 minutes of guessing into 5 minutes of reading).

The questions to answer:
1. **Does an internal API exist?** This is the first and most important question. If the site's frontend calls a JSON endpoint, scraping HTML is almost always wasted work. See `references/hidden-apis.md`.
2. **What anti-bot vendor protects the site?** Cloudflare, DataDome, PerimeterX/HUMAN, Akamai, AWS WAF, or just naive rate limiting. Each has a signature and a different tool ladder. The detection model is the same across all of them - four pillars (IP reputation, fingerprinting, behavior, active challenges) - but the emphasis differs. See `references/anti-bot-strategies.md`.
3. **Is the content rendered server-side or client-side?** Static HTML allows HTTP-only crawling (10-100× cheaper). SPAs require a browser.
4. **What is the volume target?** Ten URLs per day is not a thousand per minute. Volume drives proxy strategy and concurrency.
5. **What is the data shape?** A search-results page with pagination is not a single product detail page. Crawler topology depends on this.

**Actively probe the anti-bot, don't just identify it.** Beyond reading signatures, fire test requests at the target through the research/scraping APIs and MCP tools available - Firecrawl, ZenRows, ScrapFly, ScraperAPI, Tavily/Exa, the Apify console - to observe *how the protection actually behaves*: does a plain fetch get a 403 or a silent-200? does a residential-proxy managed call get through where datacenter fails? does JS rendering change the result? Each probe (always off the local IP) narrows the tool/proxy choice with evidence instead of a guess. A real browser (Wappalyzer + DevTools) is the best surface for first-time recon.

**The objective of Phase 1 is not just "which vendor protects this."** It is to define the full plan that will let you scrape reliably: the tool rung, the proxy tier and country, the pacing/timing and concurrency budget, the session/token-replay strategy, and the escalation plan if the first bet fails. Phase 1 ends with that one-page plan (see the diagnostic output in `references/diagnostic.md`) - not with a vendor name.

### Phase 2 - Choose the cheapest viable tool

The default is the cheapest tool that works. Browsers are 10-100× more expensive in compute, memory, and proxy credits than HTTP. Camoufox specifically averages 200 MB RAM per instance and tens of seconds per Cloudflare challenge - usable, but not for commodity volumes. The full decision tree lives in `references/tool-ladder.md`. The compressed version:

| Target characteristics | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Internal JSON API exists | `got-scraping` + Cheerio (or just `got-scraping`) | Fastest, cheapest, returns structured data |
| Static HTML, no anti-bot | `CheerioCrawler` | 20× faster than browser, no JS overhead |
| Static HTML, basic rate-limit/header checks | `CheerioCrawler` + datacenter proxies + sessions | Crawlee handles fingerprints automatically |
| Mixed static/dynamic (multi-site crawl) | `AdaptivePlaywrightCrawler` | Switches HTTP↔browser per page |
| JS-rendered, no major anti-bot | `PlaywrightCrawler` + default fingerprints | Real browser TLS, automatic stealth |
| Cloudflare (basic), Akamai (basic), DataDome | `PlaywrightCrawler` + residential proxies + fingerprints | Crawlee's built-in fingerprint injection |
| Cloudflare Enterprise, HUMAN Security, hard targets | Camoufox + residential proxies, or managed API | Engine-level stealth or paid bypass |
| LinkedIn, Amazon, SERP at scale | Managed API (ZenRows, ScrapFly, Bright Data Scraping Browser) | DIY economics break - pay for someone else's arms race |

Camoufox is currently the only open-source tool achieving 0% headless-detection scores - but at real cost. Use it deliberately, not by default.

### Phase 3 - Implement with resilience baked in

Resilient scrapers are not scrapers with extra try/catch. Resilience is structural. The non-negotiables:

- **Selectors with fallbacks.** Never depend on a single CSS selector for a critical field. Layered fallbacks (`.price-current ?? [data-price] ?? .price`) survive A/B tests and minor redesigns. See `references/selector-strategy.md`.
- **Sessions and proxy rotation are configured, not coded by hand.** Crawlee's `useSessionPool: true` plus a proxy configuration is enough for 80% of cases (and Crawlee runs anywhere, not just on Apify). On Apify, see `references/apify-patterns.md` for the concrete config.
- **Cache external responses by default.** Put a cache layer in front of every third-party response - KV Store on Apify, Redis/Postgres/disk on a standalone host - with a ~30-day TTL. Pattern: `{source}-cache:{hash}`. Saves money and rate-limit pressure.
- **Retries with exponential backoff at the right layer.** Crawlee handles request-level retries. You handle business-logic retries (LLM/API rate limits, third-party API errors).
- **Surface progress and degraded states from inside the run.** Whatever the operator watches - `Actor.setStatusMessage()` in the Apify console, structured logs, a run-status row in your DB - keep it updated so a run's health is visible without reading raw logs.

### Phase 4 - Handle errors as a first-class output

The principle is platform-agnostic: **treat blocks and errors as a categorized, structured output, not as exceptions that crash the run.** A business-logic failure - invalid input, blocked by target, third-party API down, file corrupted, no results found - is emitted as a structured error record to whatever your output sink is (an Apify dataset row, a Postgres error column/table, a JSON line in a log), so the operator sees *what happened* without reading raw logs. The run-level success signal (process exit code, or the platform's run status) is reserved for genuine infrastructure failure (OOM, crash).

Two parts of this are doctrine you carry everywhere:
- **The failure taxonomy.** `TARGET_BLOCKED` ≠ `EXTRACTION_FAILED` ≠ rate-limit ≠ `TARGET_NOT_FOUND` ≠ bad-input - each gets different handling. Critically, **a 200 with an empty or fake body is a silent block, not a success**; schema-validate the result and treat a validation miss as a block. The full taxonomy and decision table are in `references/error-handling-ppe.md` (the Apify implementation; the taxonomy itself is general).
- **Commit irreversible side effects only on confirmed success.** On Apify this is the graceful-exit + PPE-billing pattern (`Actor.charge()` only after the data is committed - never on retry/partial/error); on a standalone host it's "COMMIT the DB transaction / fire the webhook only after the scrape succeeded." Same rule, different mechanism. Apify deployment specifics (exit SUCCEEDED, `Actor.charge`, free-plan handling) live in `references/error-handling-ppe.md`.

### Phase 5 - Test without hitting the network

Tests use Vitest (or pytest equivalent) with fixture-based mocks. The test suite must run with no network access at all. Mock everything that crosses the process boundary:
- `got-scraping`, `firecrawl` (the Firecrawl SDK), any HTTP client used at runtime
- your platform/runtime SDK (on Apify: `Actor.charge()`, `Actor.openKeyValueStore()`, `Actor.pushData()`; elsewhere: your DB client, cache, queue)
- any third-party SDK (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)

Fixtures (HTML or JSON snapshots from the target, scrubbed of PII) live in `tests/fixtures/`. The parser is tested against the fixture, not the live site. Coverage targets are: every field extracted, every error path, every selector fallback. See `references/testing-fixtures.md`.

Running tests: `npx vitest run` (or `pytest`). Never `--watch` mode in CI, and never with live network calls.

## The golden rules

Distilled from production experience, platform-agnostic. When in doubt, return to these.

1. **Internal API first.** Spend twenty minutes in the browser DevTools Network panel before writing a selector. Nine times out of ten there is a JSON endpoint. Vivino's public-facing pseudo-API (`/api/explore/explore`, `/api/wines/{id}/reviews`) is the canonical example - what could have been a Camoufox-grade scraper is a lightweight HTTP client hitting JSON.

2. **Cheapest viable tool first.** Start one rung lower than you think you need on the tool ladder. Escalate only on observed failure. A Playwright scraper for a static site burns 10× the budget for nothing.

3. **Categorize errors and blocks before handling them.** A 403 from anti-bot is not the same problem as a 403 from a missing token. A 429 with `Retry-After` is not the same as a 429 from IP burn. A 200 with an empty/fake body is a silent block, not a success. Treat each class separately. See the taxonomy in `references/error-handling-ppe.md`.

4. **Cache external calls by default.** Every external response goes through a cache layer (KV Store, Redis, Postgres, or disk) with a ~30-day TTL. Cache reads happen before any external request. The pattern is unconditional - opting out is the exception, not the rule.

**On Apify specifically**, two more rules apply at the deployment layer: *always exit SUCCEEDED* (business errors go in the dataset, never `Actor.fail()`) and *PPE charges fire only on confirmed success* (`Actor.charge()` last, never on retry/partial/error). Both live in `references/error-handling-ppe.md`.

## Quick decision flow

When the user asks to scrape site X:

```
1. Identify the site. Have you scraped a similar target before?
   YES → Reuse the established pattern from prior work on that target.
   NO  → Continue.

2. Probe (without local IP):
   - Open the site in DevTools or use a managed API to fetch.
   - Check for internal JSON endpoints.
   - Check Set-Cookie headers and challenge pages for anti-bot signatures.

3. Map to tool:
   - Internal API found? → got-scraping + Cheerio.
   - Static HTML, light protection? → CheerioCrawler.
   - JS-heavy? → PlaywrightCrawler.
   - Cloudflare/DataDome/HUMAN? → Camoufox or managed API.

4. Estimate cost (unit economics):
   - cost-per-result (compute + proxy + managed-API fees) vs. value-per-result.
   - Volume × cost-per-call → does it work? (If monetizing on Apify, the PPE price must absorb this with margin.)

5. Architecture & deployment shape:
   - Single job or a suite (e.g., search + detail + price)?
   - Where does it run - standalone script/cron, serverless, web-app backend, Apify Actor, or MCP server?

6. Implement Phase 3 → 4 → 5.
```

## When to read each reference

The body above gives you the operational answer 80% of the time. Reach for `references/` when:

**Core scraping doctrine (any platform):**

| Read this | When you need to… |
|---|---|
| `references/diagnostic.md` | Identify what anti-bot protects an unknown site, probe its behavior, decode HTTP responses, and define the full plan (tool + proxy + pacing + escalation) |
| `references/hidden-apis.md` | Find and use internal JSON endpoints (Vivino-style), reverse-engineer GraphQL, extract embedded `__NEXT_DATA__` |
| `references/tool-ladder.md` | Choose between Cheerio / Playwright / Camoufox / managed APIs with full decision criteria |
| `references/anti-bot-strategies.md` | Configure escalation: HTTP+headers → sessions → throttling → browser → managed API. Know exactly what to try next |
| `references/selector-strategy.md` | Build resilient selectors, layered fallbacks, schema validation, deal with A/B tests and SPA rerenders |
| `references/managed-apis.md` | Compare Firecrawl, ZenRows, ScrapFly, ScraperAPI, Bright Data Scraping Browser. Choose, integrate, fail over |

| `references/legal-ethics.md` | Address ToS, robots.txt, GDPR, copyright, IDV limits, defensible scraping practices |

**Apify deployment doctrine** (Apify-specific - read for Apify-deployment specifics. Note: the **failure taxonomy** inside `error-handling-ppe.md` is platform-agnostic and is summarized in Phase 4, so a non-Apify reader takes the taxonomy from Phase 4 and skips the rest of that file):

| Read this | When you need to… |
|---|---|
| `references/apify-patterns.md` | Set up `actor.json`, input_schema, Apify proxy/session config, KV Store cache, autoscaling, memory tiers, MCP Standby mode |
| `references/error-handling-ppe.md` | Implement the Apify graceful-exit pattern, structure dataset error output, configure PPE events, handle free-plan users (the failure *taxonomy* it documents is platform-agnostic; the *implementation* is Apify) |

## What this skill is not

- **Not a copy of the platform/library docs.** Use the Crawlee docs, Playwright docs, or Apify Academy directly when you need API specs. This skill is the *opinionated layer above* - what to do, in what order, with what trade-offs.
- **Not a replacement for site-specific knowledge.** When working on a scraper for a known target (Vivino, Wine-Searcher, Instagram), check your prior notes and the target's existing scraper source first.
- **Not a license to hit unfamiliar sites without checking ToS.** See `references/legal-ethics.md`.
